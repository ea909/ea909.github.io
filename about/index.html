<h1>Software Development</h1>
<p>


I write software, both professionally and as a hobby. Most of my professional
work has been in embedded systems, specifically small 8, 16, and 32 bit
microcontrollers plus a bit of VHDL. In addition to embedded work, I've
worked on a lot of desktop application software to interface with or
operate custom hardware.

</p>
<p>
 
In my hobbies, my focus is on audio synthesis, game development,
and some graphics programming.

</p>
<p>

Some stuff I have done:
</p>
<ul>

<li>
 C and C++
</li>
<li>
 Microcontrollers, specifically Microchip's line.
</li>
<li>
 Some VHDL (for Xilinx FPGAs).
</li>
<li>
 Windows API wrangling, sockets, aynchronous IO, general systems programming.
</li>
<li>
 OpenGL 3, custom GUI development, shaders, mostly 2D work.
</li>
<li>
 Audio programming: mixing, sequencers, synthesizers, filters.
</li>
<li>
 C#, GUI with Winforms and WPF.
</li>
<li>
 Python, GUI with pyGTK, ML and text mining with pyTorch, numpy, scikit-learn
</li>
<li>
 Lua scripting for various things.
</li>
<li>
 HTML5 and CSS for a static site generator.

</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h1>Fonts Info</h1>

For those who are wondering, if the links on this site were not
green, some colorblind people would not see the links well over the blue
background. With green links, the worst case is they reduce to the same color
as everything else (white or orange-yellow), after which the underline is
still visible to indicate that it is a hyperlink.
