wolfygame 1/28/19</h1>


<p>

So &quot;wolfygame&quot; is just a place-holder title for a small raycasting (<i>
not</i>

raytracing) engine I'm working on. I've written this in the past, but never
went far beyond wall, floor and ceiling texturing (I did add diffuse lighting
though :D). Hopefully, this one can add some more interesting features,
particularly, different floor heights.

</p>
<p>

So, a RAYCASTING engine is an engine in the style of the game Wolfenstein 3D,
where the map is a 2D tile map, but it is rendered in 3D as a set of walls:

</p>

<p>

The more familiar raytracing casts one ray per pixel, whereas raycasting casts
one ray per column of the screen. The first (or several, with multiheight
floors) collision with a wall is found and a (textured) vertical strip is
drawn scaled based on the distance. Do this for each column and you get a 3D
render of the 2D map. Because it casts a ray per column, it is limited to 2D
geometry with walls and floors always perpendicular.

</p>

<h1>Tutorials</h1>
<p>


There are two main tutorials on raycasting on the internet: 
<a href="https://permadi.com/1996/05/ray-casting-tutorial-table-of-contents/">permadi</a>
and <a href="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html">lodev</a>. Both
tutorials are good, but they both have a couple problems.

</p>
<section>
<h1>Permadi</h1>
<p>


This tutorial is the most intuitive one. It takes its time and explains things
well. It solves everything using basic trigonometry. However, if you implement
its algorithm as described and then raise the field of view (FOV) up to 90, as
you would on a widescreen monitor, the sides of the screen look warped.  (...
also, why oh why do console game ports so often ship with 60 degress FOV?!
...).

</p>
<p>

The problem has to do with how it determines the direction of the rays. It
does something like this:

</p>
<pre><code>double field_of_view = 90.0;
double angle_player_faces = 45.0;
for (int column = 0; column &lt; screen_width; column++) {
    float angle_of_ray = angle_player_faces - field_of_view / 2 +
            ((double)column / (double)screen_width) * field_of_view

    ... use the angle, cast the ray, etc ...
}
</code></pre>


<p>
 The angle of each ray is calculated by stepping across 90 degrees
in equal increments of degrees. This is simple to impement, but is actually
incorrect.  When modeling raycasting (or rendering in general), the viewer is
at a position behind a camera plane onto which the screen is mapped. What is
rendered to the screen represents the &quot;light&quot; that passes in to the player
point through that plane. Each ray is supposed to be for a different, equally
spaced column of the screen, so that means that each ray must start at the
player position and pass through equally spaced increments of the camera
plane. It looks like this (V2 is a 2D vector of double):

</p>
<pre><code>V2 player_direction = (V2) { .x = 1, .y = 0 };
V2 camera_plane = V2NormalOf(player_direction);
// If the camera plane is the same magnitude as the direction
// you have a 90 deg fov

for (int column = 0; column &lt; screen_width; column++) {
    // linear slide from -1 to 1:
    double amount = (2 * column) / screen_width - 1;
    V2 ray_vector = player_direction + camera_plane * amount;

    .. use the vector, cast ray, etc ...
}
</code></pre>


<p>

This is the method from the lodev tutorial and it is actually correct. If you
look at the angle of each of these ray vectors, you will find that the change
in angle from column to column is <i>
not</i>
 constant. The change is smaller
at the edges of the screen/camera plane. For example, with a screen_width of
50, the angle difference between columns near the middle of the screen is ~2.2
degrees, but near the ends it is only ~1.2.

</p>
<p>

So although most of the permadi tutorial is fine, you have to incorporate this
correct method of computing the ray vector or the result will look warped with
a high fov.

</p>

<section>
<h1>lodev</h1>
<p>


The lodev tutorial has the huge benefit of including working code with the
tutorial. It uses a different method of raycasting built around vector math and
a bresenham-style (DDA) method for casting the rays. 

At one part of the tutorial, the lengths of two variations of the ray vector
are calculated - one scaled so the X component is one, and the other scaled so
that the X component is one. The obvious, intuitive way to do this is:

</p>
<pre><code>    delta_dist_x = sqrt(1 + ray_y * ray_y / ray_x * ray_x);
    delta_dist_y = sqrt(1 + ray_x * ray_x / ray_y * ray_x);
</code></pre>
<p>


This just comes from dividing the vector by either its X or Y component and
using the pythagorean theorem. However, in the code, these are optimized into
the following:

</p>
<pre><code>    delta_dist_x = abs(1 / ray_x);
    delta_dist_y = abs(1 / ray_y);
</code></pre>


<p>

This simplification is true if and only if the ray vector is a unit vector -
however, it is not. The ray vector is the sum of the direction and plane
vectors and its length varies. As a result, these lengths are not correct. But
then why does the algorithm still work?

</p>
<p>

These values are only used to accumulate the distance travelled so far by
hopping along X and Y boundaries (side_dist_x and side_dist_y in the
tutorial). A non-unit vector will cause both delta_dist_x and delta_dist_y to
get scaled by the same amount. So, as long as you are only using these to
compare the lengths with each other, both have the same scaling error, so the
results end up the same, and it works.

</p>
<p>

Unfortunately, I could not leave it at that. I want to know the real distance
travelled while casting the ray, so that on a very large map you can quit casting
early and just draw silent hill distance fog. Fortunately, there is a very
easy way to fix this - just use a normalized ray vector:

</p>
<pre><code>    V2 ray_unit = V2Unit(ray_vector);
    delta_dist_x = abs(1 / ray_unit.x);
    delta_dist_y = abs(1 / ray_unit.y);

</code></pre>
<p>


There are some other weak points in the lodev code. Basically, its
implementation is shorter and clearer than the permadi tutorial, but it gets
there with some simplifying assumptions. It assumes that the distance between
the player and the camera plane is always 1. If you want the player to be
large compared to the map tiles and want their vision to represent this
proportionally, that value will need to change. This changes the wall height
and floor casting calculations. It also assumes that walls always have a
height of 1, that will have to change too.

</p>

<h1>So far</h1>
<p>


Step 1 was getting the basic walls, floors and ceilings with textures working:

</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">

</p>
<p>


I implemented mipmapping on the textures (or texture atlas), but with the low
resolution textures I'm using it doesn't help much (and the floors really need
anistropic filtering or much higher resolution for any real improvement). I
ended up removing the mipmaps. Here is mipmaping getting toggled on and off:

<p>


For the sake of total performance overkill, I added a basic thread pool and arranged
the renderer to divide the screen up into 
<code>
screen_width / logical_proc_count</code>

chunks to be each rendered on a separate thread. Below is a gif of three
background threads each rendering part of the screen with a 1 ms delay per
pixel. The main thread would normally be rendering the fourth quadrant, but it
is busying redrawing the screen over and over to make the animation :)
