        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        I'm Eric Alzheimer, this is my personal website.
        <p>
        At the time of writing this page, I am a software engineer at 
        <a href="https://www.oxidegames.com/">Oxide Games</a>.
        <p>
        This page is currently under construction, as I am replacing /
        revamping my old site. You can find my old site 
        <a href="oldsite/">here</a>, but the links are all surely broken at
        the moment.
        <p>
